            <p>Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today. A survey conducted by industry analyst firm RedMonk found that it was the second-most popular programming language among developers in 2021</p>

            <p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.</p>

           <p> “Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem.”</p>                
               <p> What can you do with python? Some things include:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data analysis and machine learning</li>
                    <li>Web development</li>
                    <li>Automation or scripting</li>
                    <li>Software testing and prototyping</li>
                    <li>Everyday tasks</li>

            <header>Why is Python so popular?</header>
            <p>Python is popular for a number of reasons. Here’s a deeper look at what makes it so versatile and easy to use for coders.</p>
            <p>
                <li> It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects, and faster to improve on them.</li>
                
                <li>It’s versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.</li>
                
                <li>It’s beginner friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.</li>
                
                <li>It’s open source, which means it’s free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.</li>
                
                <li>Python’s archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is vast and growing.</li>
                
                <li>Python has a large and active community that contributes to Python’s pool of modules and libraries, and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers. The vast support community means that if coders run into a stumbling block, finding a solution is relatively easy; somebody is bound to have run into the same problem before.</li>
